## Predictive Modeling of Student Academic Performance to Identify At-Risk Students

This project addresses a key challenge for platforms
like Coursera: identifying factors that influence student success.
Using the "Student Performance" dataset from the
[UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance),
this project will be a predictive modeling (regression and classification) task.
The dataset includes student demographic, social, and school-related
data (like study time and absences), and the goal is to build
a model that accurately predicts a student's final grade.

This project is a classic demonstration of the data science pipeline:
data cleaning, extensive exploratory analysis
(to find which factors actually correlate with grades),
and feature engineering. Multiple models
(Linear and Classification) will be built and
evaluated.
