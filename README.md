## Predictive Modeling of Student Academic Performance to Identify At-Risk Students

This edtech-focused project addresses a key challenge for platforms
like Coursera: identifying factors that influence student success.
Using the "Student Performance" dataset from the
(UCI Repository)[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance],
this project will be a predictive modeling (regression) task.
The dataset includes student demographic, social, and school-related
data (like study time and absences), and the goal is to build
a model that accurately predicts a student's final grade.

This project is a classic demonstration of the data science pipeline:
data cleaning, extensive exploratory analysis
(to find which factors actually correlate with grades),
and feature engineering. Multiple regression models
(from Linear Regression to Gradient Boosting) will be built and
evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
to find the most accurate one.
The ethical reflection willcritically discuss the use of
such models in education, the risk of "labeling" students,
and data privacy concerns.
